\label{sec:introduction}

This report summarizes the results of the laboratory exercises conducted in the lecture "AI-M-1: Selected Topics of Embedded Software Development I - Embedded Connectivity (SS25)". This includes general tasks, as well as group-specific tasks. They were worked on in the following order: \\\\
At the beginning a preparation task was completed, which helps to familiarize the user with the setup and lets him collect important data for the following tasks. The first practical tasks involved establishing basic point-to-point communication using the ANDi tool in loopback mode. The knowledge and scripts developed in the loopback setup were then transferred to the real-world scenario, connecting devices within the lab to observe behaviour and performance under realistic conditions. Finally, a connection is established between the gateway of the user's own workstation and the lab's central Media Gateway to access the camera connected to it. \\\\
Upon completion of these core assignments, the group of this report worked on the topic "Automotive MicroController - Aurix ". The goal was to realize a CAN Ethernet Gateway with an "Infineon TriCore Board".
